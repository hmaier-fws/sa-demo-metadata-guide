The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\nScience Catalog Goals and Objectives\nGoal 1: Provide an easily searchable repository for SA-funded science projects and products through the SA Science Catalog.\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all SA projects and products>\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what SA has funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the SA Science Catalog instance will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov and elsewhere, if needed.\nGoal 2: Increase transparency of SA project funding information.\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects.\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\nGoal 3: Demonstrate the impact and value of the investment in landscape-scale conservation.\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by SA and the partners and collaborators involved.\nGoal 4: Illustrate the link between SA-funded applied science projects and today’s conservation challenges.\nObjective 4.1: Link SA projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues.\n"},"lcc-science-catalog.html":{"url":"lcc-science-catalog.html","title":"SA Science Metadata Catalog","summary":"This is a front matter description","keywords":"","body":"SA Science Metadata Catalog\nPage description = This is a front matter description\nA more detailed look at the metadata requirements and architecture behind the Science Applications Science Catalog.\nFont tests below:\n\n\nFA icon using ->  \nFA icon using ->  \n\n\nFont test above\nOverview2\nThe SA Science Catalog collates the metadata from all FWS regions and Headquarters. It allows for user-defined searching and filtering of projects and products as well as access to products for download. Users can see what has been funded, which can help prevent duplication of work. The SA Science Catalog also enables reporting, such as funding summaries or project examples based on particular geographies, species, organization, year, or other categories of interest.\nArchitecture2 [editing in progress]\nAt present, SA creates and edits metadata in mdEditor and then publish the metadata to ScienceBase, where it can be channeled to the SA Science Catalog and data.gov. The mdTranslator tool is integrated with mdEditor so you can create metadata once, and then convert and publish the metadata in your desired format, such as mdJSON for the SA Science Catalog, sbJSON for ScienceBase, XML for data.gov, and FGDC for geospatial data.\nThe following diagram details the LCC Science Catalog system architecture.\n\n\nItems are imported from a database (like ScienceBase), or created directly in mdEditor.\nmdJSON files can also be stored in a local repository and then transmitted via a web service to ScienceBase. Alternately, the local files can be exported to a web accessible folder and then harvested by ScienceBase.\nThe mdTranslator converts the mdJSON files into sbJSON (the ScienceBase JSON format), and XML.\nItems are exported from ScienceBase to: Data.gov as XML; the SA Science Catalog website as Projects and Products; or into mdEditor as mdJSON.\n\n"},"policy-guidance.html":{"url":"policy-guidance.html","title":"Non Duplication Policy Guidance","keywords":"","body":"Non Duplication Policy Guidance\nNon Duplication Policy\nBased on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting.  This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to discover and engage in SA supported science as desired. \n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project metadata for Non Duplication Policy\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contacts (see Main Tab: Project)\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period\nRequired\n\n\nFunding: Award Number, amount, source, fiscal year, recipients\nRequired\n\n\n\nBelow is a copy of the Non Duplication Policy guidance memo, in detail for reference: \n \nGuidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities\nBackground\nOn September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this dashboard for a list of resources.\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\na.      If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n\nSearch for duplicative projects in ScienceBase (use the ScienceBase search template).\n\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\n\nInclude peer review as part of project selection. \nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\nDetermine if the project is a research project or other science activity (required). Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\na.      If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file (required).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n\nConsider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\na.      Document your search of ScienceBase using the ScienceBase search template.\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\nd.      Include copies of ScienceBase search template and corresponding results (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nRepeat Practice 2 at https://catalog.data.gov and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the ScienceBase search template to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\n\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\n\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/funding recipient’s[1] name and contact info,\nPI/Funding recipient’s organization,\nstart date,\nprojected end date,\nabstract,\naward ID,\nfunding sources and amounts.\n\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder...email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is…Start with slides  from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies...This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right...Call or email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703.358.1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient.\n"},"getting-started/":{"url":"getting-started/","title":"Workflow","keywords":"","body":"Workflow\nSuggested Workflow for SA Metadata and mdEditor\nThe following is a suggested workflow for using mdEditor to create, publish, and save metadata records for SA projects and products.\nStep 1: Gather information needed for your metadata entries.\nHave information about your contacts, projects, and products on hand before you begin creating metadata records.

Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information (e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications).  Think of it as a Social Security Number for your data.  DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards (ISO).  DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service (e.g., DataCite or CrossRef) that maintains the link to the resource. \nDOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs.  Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.\nFor more information on DOIs, see Digital Object Identifier Handbook.\nThe Service Digital Object Identifier Management Tool enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with DataCite, to Service-funded data products and other resources.  This tool is used to mint (create), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs.  DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.\n\nFigure 1 from Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide\nOnce minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2)\n\nThis Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Science Analytics and Synthesis (SAS) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.\nDOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products (such as data releases, services, models, and reports), with the exception of primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation metadata, including the title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data. These citation metadata can be updated at any time.\nBefore you being, collect required metadata information as follows:\n\n\n\nMetadata\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nRequired\n\n\nResource Type\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contact\nRequired\n\n\nDate\nRequired\n\n\nAbstract\nRequired\n\n\nRepository URL\nRequired\n\n\n\nCreating and maintaining a DOI\nThe DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The beta version is useful as a training resource to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The live version is where you go to actually create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the live version have a prefix of 10.7944.\nTo login to the DOI Tool:\n\nUse your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.\n\nMinting a DOI\nMinting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency.  The DOI can be referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the project, reducing the need for updating later.\nTo mint a DOI, follow these steps:\n\nEnter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?” section in the login page (Figure 1). The DOI does not need to be published publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.\n\n\nThe DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a product identifier suffix (Figure 2). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of 10.7964.  The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.\n\nOnce created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports, publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as necessary.\n\nDuring the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI metadata should be updated.\n\nOnce the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI. This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing page.\n\nYou can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard(s). See the DOI Administration section below for more information.\n\nInclude the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2b).  As an identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.\n\nInclude the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record (Figure 2c).  In this case the entire DOI url is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDOI Administration\nThe Service has secured a large, yet limited bank (range) of DOIs. Once minted, the DOI is valid in perpetuity. If you are new to the DOI, please get familiar with the tool in the training beta version. When ready to officially reserve a DOI, use the live version of the tool.  The DOI tool was not intended to be used do not for data assets that were not initiated, funded, or delivered as part of a Service project.\nTo date the Service has not identified a responsible party or governance for administering DOIs within the Service. As a result, the duties of DOI administration must fall to the collective of Service DOI creators/editors. DOI administration duties include:\nEnsuring minted DOIs are being used for their intended purpose, which includes:  \n\nMinimizing the number of DOIs being minted and never published,\nEnsuring one DOI per digital object (e.g. research reports, data sets, service, etc.)\nEnsuring URL paths are still resolvable (no broken web links attached to the DOI)\n\n\nProviding usage reports\nHelping to reconcile previous DOIs from other DOI services\nEnhancing supplemental DOI metadata\n\nEach Service program, currently without enterprise level governance, has the option to administer the assignment of DOIs to their data assets within their program such that it meets their workflow. While the tool is available for any Service employee to login and create a DOI, a program may prefer to have a process to trigger a review or notification before a DOI is created. For example, an employee may login and create a DOI during planning set the DOI to hidden until the data and set edit rights to other accountable data staff.  Once completed and approved, the DOI status can be set to public.\n\nBulk DOI Creation and Updates API\nThis tool also has an optional Web API (application programming interface) component for the automated creation and editing of DOIs and may be useful for bulk creation of DOIs through scripting/programming. After logging into the tool with your Department of Interior Active Directory credentials, see the DOI API link for more information.\n\n"},"product-entry-guidance/":{"url":"product-entry-guidance/","title":"Product Entry Guidance","keywords":"","body":"Product Entry Guidance\nThe Product Entry Guidance section will cover how to create a metadata record for a product.

SA metadata requirements and best practices described in Project Entry Guidance still apply, unless otherwise noted below.\nGoals\nThe goals for these guidelines are:\n\nto identify when a project is co-funded and which protocol to follow;\nto maintain consistent, quality metadata records for projects and products across all FWS regions for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog;\nto avoid duplicate reporting of the same funding dollars, while also allowing each regional program to fully describe its financial contribution and  project support;\nto avoid the appearance of duplicated research efforts between FWS and CASCs or other federal bureaus (see Policy Guidance)\nand to clearly communicate the relationships between separate, but related, FWS and CASC funded projects to the public.\n\nTerms\nMulti-regional refers to a single project or product that is supported by more than one FWS region. Support may come in the form of collaboration, in-kind donations of effort, and/or funding allocations.\nMulti-regional co-funded refers to a single project that is financially supported by more than one region.\nLead region refers to the region that was instrumental in initializing and administering a project. There can be only one lead region per project.\nCASC co-funded refers to a single project or product that is supported by one or more FWS region and one or more USGS Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs).\nMatching refers to funds or in-kind donations of effort that are provided by organizations outside of FWS.\nProject is a particular effort in a particular geography with specific outcomes.\nSub-project is an effort that is related to a project, but is distinctly different in some specific aspect, such as geography, goal, or product. A sub-project often expands the scope of a project or grows from a research need identified by the project (aka parent project). If two regions fund similar work in different geographical regions, or for different species with separate deliverables, then these are considered to be separate projects. If both projects are part of a larger effort, and/or administered from the same grant, and/or developed in collaboration with the same investigators, then these are sub-projects.\nScenario Descriptions\nCollaborating Project: One Service region leads a project with joint support or cooperation in the form of advisory consultation or staff time from another region. The collaborating region(s) does not provide direct funding support.\nSub-Project (see definition above): One region (Region A) is the lead for a large project (parent project), while another region (Region B), funds a distinct sub-project effort or distinct deliverable of the large project.  This scenario can apply to FWS-CASC parent projects and may include project continuations when new objectives or deliverables are described.\nMulti-regional Co-funded Project: One region leads a project with funding support from another region(s). The project cannot be divided into distinct sub-projects.\nFWS/CASC Co-funded Project: FWS region(s) and CASC(s) co-fund a project without distinct sub-projects or products.\nSee the flowchart below for identifying which protocol to follow.\n\n"},"multi-lcc-and-co-funded-projects/sub-project-protocol/":{"url":"multi-lcc-and-co-funded-projects/sub-project-protocol/","title":"Sub-Project Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Sub-Project Protocol\nApplicability\nRefer to this protocol if:\n\nA region or program funds a distinct portion or sub-project of a larger project (aka parent project) or a distinct product of project  supported by another region or program, see Sub-project of FWS Region or Program Project.\nA FWS region or program funds a distinct portion of a CASC project or vice-versa, see Sub-project of CASC Project.\n\nIn this case, the funding information should only be entered in a project metadata record once. If the funding for a sub-project is distributed separately, then it can be included in the sub-project metadata. Otherwise, if the sub-project was funded from a parent project and the funding allocation is not distinctly identified, then all the funding information should be included in the parent project metadata.

See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\nMain/Citation\n(2) Responsible Parties need to have a valid role selected. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\nMetadata Repositories\n(3a) Ensure you have a single version of your data.gov tag and it is consistent across all of your items. See ScienceBase scanner.\n(3b) If you update your Metadata Repositories in mdJSON and publish to ScienceBase, you will also need to delete the erroneous version from ScienceBase (called Harvest Sets in SB). The issue is that SB doesn’t remove tags when an item is republished, it just adds to tags. This issue applies to all keywords, but it is most important to fix for Harvest Sets. This scenario can happen with both erroneous data.gov tags or misspelled Harvest Set tagging.\nYou may want to consider using the injector script to delete or replace erroneous versions from mdJSON. You would still be required required to manually remove the erroneous versions from SB items.\nFunding\n(4) LCC allocations need to list the funding agency as the source (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), not the LCC. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\n\nAdditionally, all funding from other FWS programs need to list FWS as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or refuge where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of \"administrator\").\n\n(5) All allocations should list the fiscal year when the funds were allocated (this is different than a project's overall start and end dates - those are entered in Main/Time Period). There should be only a single fiscal year identified per allocation. Use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the date fields.\n\n(6) All allocation recipients should be an Organization, not an Individual contact. Clarifications, although not required, can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (e.g., list a \"principalInvestigator\").\nContacts\n(7) All contacts need the appropriate contactType identified—this is particularly important for funding summaries. See QA/QC list from DJ Case.\n(8) Address the Contact QA/QC list from DJ Case.\n\nNote: this is a static list that was generated during the initial creation of the Science Catalog.

Affected records can be viewed here (this is a link to a saved Science Catalog search for the erroneous keyword).\nDistribution\n(10) Distribution links need to be included for products. This was already required for all products and this is particularly critical for items sent to data.gov. This is the only online resource data.gov reads so without a URL here, there is no way for a user to access the actual product. The recommended role is \"distributor\" (see the Product Distribution section for more info).\nNote: Matt Heller is looking into a solution (mid-November) using the injector script so data managers could run this automated process themselves to meet minimum requirements.\nFixing Errors\n(11) Republish any records that don’t have mdJSON attached (without mdJSON, the item will not show up in the Science Catalog). See ScienceBase scanner.\n(12) Go through errors/warnings in the ScienceBase scanner (e.g., no ISO Keyword, bad repo tag, etc.) .\n(13) Address remaining QA/QC issues from DJ Case.\n(14) Fix the errors identified by the ASG in manual QA/QC checks of the Science Catalog.

This may have been an issue introduced for LCCs who used the template scripting (i.e., input metadata into a spreadsheet that Josh scripted into mdEditor to create your initial metadata records). Below is a possible way to check and solve that issue.\n(1) If you go into the Keywords section of your record, you may see that there are entries under \"Selected Keywords\" but those selections aren't highlighted green in the tree of options.\n(2) Click on the desired options in the tree, which will add a duplicate set of those keywords in \"Selected Keywords.\" \n(3) Delete the duplicate keywords from the top of the list. \n(4) Now your keywords should be selected properly.

Please refresh this manual every time you open it to ensure you are viewing the most recent version.\nIf you have questions/concerns regarding this guidance, please contact the FWS SA National Data Steward (sadatasteward@fws.gov) or Tammy Patterson (tpatterson@usgs.gov until August 1).\nIntroduction\nThis manual describes the requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products for USFWS Science Applications. These metadata requirements conform to the standardized metadata format agreed upon by the SA Data Management Working Group and meets USFWS policy requirements for data management. This metadata drives the unified SA Science Catalog, where SA projects and products are discoverable, accessible, and usable.\nUSFWS Data Management Integration\nMetadata creation is part of the Maintain step of the Data Management Lifecycle.   Guidance is also available in the USFWS data management handbook.\nMetadata and mdEditor\nThe metadata editing tool employed to create and support metadata requirements is mdEditor. This tool was an extension of an initiative by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIwg) and adopted by SA.\nThis manual refers to the creation of SA metadata specifically. If you want information on the creation of other metadata records using mdEditor, or more information in general, please refer to the mdEditor User Manual.\nWho Should Use this Manual\nThis guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for SA-related projects and products. The primary purpose is to describe in detail how to develop metadata for items for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog, but the tool can also be used to track any project or funding.\nThe metadata requirements described here apply to science projects and products that were funded by SA (for more details, see the Project, Products, and Contacts section).\nHow to Use this Manual\nDirectly accessing this manual from the internet is the recommended way to use this manual. By doing so, you will guarantee that you are using the current version since it is a live document and any updates can be made instantly. The online version will also have the best functionality and graphical display.\nIf needed, you can download this manual as a PDF and save a copy to your computer for printing or offline use. If you choose this method, be sure to reference the online version regularly and save a new PDF as updates are made to the online version. Also note that not all of the formatting will be exactly the same as the online version.\nSome of the stylized text boxes (like this one) will not translate to the PDF exactly. The text will still be outlined with a background color, but the icon to the left of the text will not display in the PDF.\n\nDisclaimer\nThis manual was developed while mdEditor was also being developed. Due to this, there may be minor discrepancies between screenshots in the manual and the current production version of mdEditor.\n"},"data-management/import/":{"url":"data-management/import/","title":"Import","keywords":"","body":"Import\nThe Import function loads an mdEditor or mdJSON file into the current mdEditor session. You can also import existing ScienceBase metadata or FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee) metadata into mdEditor to create mdJSON.\nGeneral Import Settings\nReplace vs. Merge\nThe Replace/Merge toggle allows you to either replace or merge the imported records with the records currently loaded in mdEditor. In most instances you should select \"Merge.\" An exception is when you want to import Settings associated with an mdEditor file (see below).\nSelecting \"Replace\" will remove all metadata records currently in mdEditor and leave only the newly-imported files. If you are importing a record to add to the existing records, choose \"Merge.\"\n\nImport Settings\nOnly mdEditor files store Settings information; mdJSON files do not. You must import Settings to retain metadata repository information, default ScienceBase parent identifier, and auto-save preference. To import the Settings with an mdEditor file, set the import to \"Replace\" (be sure you have already saved a backup copy of any files currently in mdEditor). Set the mode back to \"Merge” once you’ve finished importing the Settings.\nIf you have records already loaded into mdEditor with all desired Settings, then you do not need to re-import Settings when you import additional mdEditor files.\nSee next sections for specific file format import guidance on mdJSON, sbJSON, and FGDC metadata.\n"},"data-management/export.html":{"url":"data-management/export.html","title":"Export","keywords":"","body":"Export\nThe export function allows the current set of metadata records to be saved as an mdEditor or mdJSON file. The saved files can be shared with collaborators, imported into another record set, imported into another browser. Exported mdEditor files should be saved as a backup or archival copy.\nUsing Export to Backup Records\nExporting records is the only way to save mdEditor files outside of your browser cache. You should backup by exporting an mdEditor JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor or switch browsers.\nmdEditor files vs. mdJSON files\nmdJSON files can be uploaded and translated to other formats via the mdTranslator application while mdEditor files are exclusive to the mdEditor application and retain all mdEditor information, including Settings.\nBest Practices\n\nFor a complete backup, use the Export All button. This exports an mdEditor file containing all records and contacts currently loaded in mdEditor.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your mdEditor library, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact to that record.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn more.\n\nExport Options\nWhile exporting data, there are four options available (on the right side of the export data window).\n\n\nExport All: will export everything currently loaded in mdEditor into a single file. Exports an mdEditor JSON file.\nExport Selected: will only export the items you have selected (so individual records, contacts, etc.). If nothing is selected it will be disabled (i.e., grayed out). This exports an mdEditor JSON file.\nExport mdJSON: only works for metadata records (i.e., doesn't work for contacts). Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have translated into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.\nClicking the Include Settings switch will also export mdEditor settings (only for mdEditor files). Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn about settings.\n\nIf you need to switch browsers for mdEditor, or want to send your settings to someone else, you can export the settings. Someone else can then re-import your settings which include the default Metadata Repositories and Publishing Settings. This will give users that you share with information on your items' folder location on ScienceBase and let users know what your default repository is. Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn about settings.\n\n"},"project-entry-guidance/":{"url":"project-entry-guidance/","title":"Project Entry Guidance","keywords":"","body":"Project Entry Guidance\nThe Project Entry Guidance section will cover how to create a metadata record for an SA project.\nBefore You Begin\nAdjust your mdEditor Settings:\nMetadata Repositories: Make sure your default settings are correct for the SA Science Catalog and data.gov.

The Service data manager is responsible communications with the partner agency and for processing the project and product metadata for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog. The CASC data manager will complete their metadata responsibilities for the CASC records independently according to their requirements.\nCo-funded Project Workflow\nFor projects and products co-funded with the CASC, the CASCs will create their own ScienceBase items according to their requirements. In order for those projects and products to be included in the SA Science Catalog, a duplicate metadata records need to be created and linked to the CASC metadata records. While duplicate metadata records are not the preferred option, the specific individual requirements for each agency warrants this system.   \nThe general approach is to make a copy of the CASC metadata in mdEditor, modify the metadata to meet SA metadata requirements, including the repository tag for the Science Catalog, add a statement in the abstract explaining the collaboration, and include a url link to the CASC ScienceBase record. The statement in the abstract and the links to the CASC ScienceBase records will clarify that these are alternate references for the same item (not duplicative efforts), and in the case of products, provide access to the actual data/tool/etc. hosted on ScienceBase.  These additions are detailed below.\nWorkflow Option 1\n\nImport the sbJSON for the CASC record.\nDelete the SBIDs specific to the CASC record.\nModify the metadata to meet SA metadata requirements.\nComplete the additional metadata requirements as described below.\n\nWorkflow Option 2\n\nCreate a record from scratch in mdEditor.\nCopy the title, abstract, and other pertinent info from the CASC ScienceBase record. \nComplete the additional metadata requirements for a co-funded project as described below.\n\nMain/Point of Contacts\nAdd all collaborating Service regions/programs and CASCs as “collaborator.”\nThe lead Service region/program should be listed as “administrator” and does not need to be added as a “collaborator.”\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of mdEditor entry for Main/Point of Contact\nMain/Citation/Online Resource\nInclude the link to the CASC's ScienceBase project page as an online resource.\n\nName the link with “X Climate Adaptation Science Center ScienceBase Project Page.”\n\nMain/Abstract\nAdd the following text as the last sentence:\n“This project was co-funded by the USFWS region [A, B, C]  and [X, Y, Z] Climate Adaptation Science Centers.

An alternate reference to this project can be found here: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5887c1c3e4b02e34393da82d.”\n\nThe CASC will include a parallel statement in the Summary field for their ScienceBase record (and link back to the this record).\nMain/Supplemental Information\nAdd the following text (Best Practice):\n“This product was co-funded by the [A, B, C] Landscape Conservation Cooperatives and [X, Y, Z] Climate Adaptation Science Centers.

This is important to provide discovery and access to items outside of the SA Science Catalog (see Figure 4).\nAdd the ScienceBase Identifier of the CASC project.\n\nFigure 4: Example of mdEditor entry for Online Resource. Online resource links must be added for associated items that do NOT have metadata in the SA Science Catalog in order to ensure access and discoverability.\nAssociations in ScienceBase\nThe only associations that ScienceBase recognizes from mdJSON are parentProject/product relationships so it will not recognize the “alternate” association created in mdEditor.

Choose a project and its products to test.\nBEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: It's recommended that you export a project and its products into its own mdEditor file. Set default parent identifier as a ScienceBase folder.\nIf you DO already have items on ScienceBase, choose one of the following approaches. Note that this procedure may affect your existing records.\nApproach 1 - Take a simple project and product set, and make a copy of the mdEditor records. In the test version, delete all ScienceBase IDs (SBIDs) and parent IDs. The SBID will either be located in the citation, or if you imported the record from SB, the SBID will be the record identifier. Set default parent identifier as a folder.\nApproach 2- Publish directly to a real record if you have confirmed a backup copy exists, in the event that the record is deleted in ScienceBase.\n\nSet your Default Parent Identifier in Settings.\n\nSelect one project with its associated products to test.\nFollow the publishing instructions above for the scenario that applies to you.\nLook for any errors in the third column. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, if it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for mdEditor: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post.\nAdvanced users can check errors using the console. Consult the Advanced Users section of this manual to learn more.\n\nVerify that your test records have published as expected in your folder on ScienceBase (or to the real record if that’s how you are testing).\n\nAfter you are satisfied with how your test records published to ScienceBase, continue to step 10.\nUpdate your mdEditor settings to your real Default Parent Identifier.\nUsing the record you just tested, proceed with publishing to the real location on ScienceBase.\nMake sure any test SBIDs are removed entirely from the record you want to actually publish.\nVerify that the real records have updated as expected.\nProceed with publishing your other records to their real locations.  It is advisable to publish 1 or 2 records at a time, since ScienceBase can time-out and fail when publishing records simultaneously.\n\n"},"other-resources/injector-script-funding.html":{"url":"other-resources/injector-script-funding.html","title":"Injector Script: Funding","keywords":"","body":"Injector Script: Funding\nThe following tutorial was developed by Matt Heller using the mdEditor File Injector script he developed, which can be used to do bulk edits on your mdEditor files. This demo specifically walks through how to add a contact with the role of \"administrator\" to funding allocations.\nA recording of this demo is available for viewing at: https://mmancusa.webex.com/mmancusa/ldr.php?RCID=b368e65eafffc4c076e9a4993f438b42\nYou will need:\n\nAccess to some mdEditor files. Note: these must be mdEditor files, NOT the mdJSON files attached to the SB items.\nPython installed on your PC.\nIf you have ArcGIS installed, there is a good chance Python is installed.\n\n\n\nSteps\n(1) Download script and other helpful files from GitHub.\na. Go to https://github.com/mmheller/mdEditorFileInjector and download all the files.\n\nb. Unzip to any folder.\n\n(2) Gather some mdEditor files for the demo test.\na. Create a folder named Demo somewhere convenient.\n\nb. Copy/paste 2-5 of YOUR mdEditor files into the Demo folder.\n\n(3) Build the string that will have the necessary arguments to run the script.\na. Open any text editor (e.g., notepad) and enter the following letters with Dashes on separate lines (–C –D –F –f –T –O).\n\nFor reference, the final version will look like this. Follow the specific steps below to write each line.\n\nb. Enter the path to the Demo folder in line –C. Note: all files and files in subfolders will be processed by the script. No original files will be edited, copies will always be made.\n\nc. Enter “metadata|funding” in line –D. This is the location in the JSON that we’re telling the script to look for finding JSON text. Note: be sure to add double quotes for this argument.\nd. For line –F\n\nCopy/paste the path to the unzipped folder with all the injector script files.\nAND copy/paste the file name inject_FundingAdministrator.txt\n\n\n\nMake sure to separate the path and filename with a back slash. This holds all the text we will inject.\ne. For line –f, do the same thing but with the file name find_FundingAdminstrator.txt. This holds all the text the script uses to find text to replace.\nf. Add False to the –T line. This indicates we’re not adding new contacts to the available contacts list.\ng. Add 6 to the –O line. This specifies the option for the more complex find/replace.\n\n(4) Edit the inject_FundingAdministrator.txt file with the Contact ID of your choice.\na. Open mdEditor, clear the cache, and then import one of the mdEditor files from the demo folder.\nb. However you want to do it, copy the Contact ID of your choice.\n\nc. Open inject_FundingAdministrator.txt in a text editor and overwrite the Contact ID value in the file. Save and then close the file.\n\nNote: The Contact ID you enter must be the same for all the mdEditor files you want to run through the processor (or are in the demo folder). If you have different Contact IDs to inject across different records, you must do these in separate iterations of the script with only the relevant mdEditor files for each contact ID. If you have different Contact IDs to add within the same record, you cannot use the script and must edit those records manually in mdEditor.\n\n(5) Open the find_FundingAdminstrator.txt file.\nMake sure it says:\n\n(6) Inspect one or more of the mdEditor files in mdEditor.\na. Go to Funding. Choose an allocation where match is not selected and click \"More.\" Then click \"Edit\" for the allocation. Scroll down and notice no entries under “Other Contacts.”\n\n(7) Run the script.\na. Back in the text editor, add two blank lines in the beginning.\n\nb. Find the path to your python.exe and enter in the 1st line. Example: C:\\Python27\\ArcGISx6410.6\\python.exe\nc. Find the path to your .py injector script file and enter in the 2nd line. Note: this will be in the folder you downloaded and unzipped. Example: C:\\Temp\\mdEditorFileInjector-master\\mdEditorFileInjector_v1.py\n\nd. Remove all the carriage returns and extra spaces, and save if desired. Note: if any of your file paths have spaces, make sure to enclose the full path/filename with double quotes.\n\ne. Open a DOS prompt.\n\nf. Copy/paste the text from your text editor into the command prompt to run.\n\n(8) Inspect the results.\na. Open mdEditor and clear the cache.\nb. Click Import. Go to the demo folder and into the new folder created. Note: each time the process runs it will create a new folder and add new files to this folder.\n\nc. Select one of the new files to import.\nd. Go to Funding. Choose an allocation where match is not selected and click \"More.\" Then click \"Edit\" for the allocation. Scroll down and notice a new entry under “Other Contacts.”\n\nNote: If it errors out, there’s a problem.

Contacts contain information such as the names of individuals or organizations, email address, physical address, website, and phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record. Contacts also enable users to know who is involved in the creation and maintenance of projects and products, funding of projects, and creation and maintenance of metadata.\nGeneral Info on Contacts\nIn mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata record. Editing a contact in the mdEditor contact library will update the contact information included in any metadata record that uses that contact. Editing a contact in mdEditor will also update contact information on ScienceBase once the record is published.\nYou should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion and unnecessary duplication errors as you edit and manage your metadata records.\n\nCopying contacts will change the ID and the name (the name will be “Copy of ….”) but all the other information will remain the same in the copy.  \nIt is recommended that you leave contacts in mdEditor between work sessions. This allows you to readily add contacts to projects and products.\nIt is recommended that when you export records, you also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your library, you may receive an error and have to re-enter the contact to that record.  This can cause duplication errors.\n\nBest Practices for Contacts\n\nAlways spell out acronyms and organization names.\nMake sure your contacts are loaded and accurate in mdEditor before creating or editing your metadata records. \n\nContacts Seed File\nThe \"contacts seed file\" contains pre-filled information and standard naming conventions for FWS, common federal agencies, and generic Data Stewards. Using this file will increase consistency across all SA metadata records for common contacts and reduce the amount of processing needed before records go into the Science Catalog.\nSA maintains a 'seed' list of contacts that can be found in the SA ScienceBase community item page.\nImporting Contacts from ScienceBase\nWhen you import a ScienceBase record, mdTranslator will automatically load all sbJSON contacts into Main/Citation/Responsible Parties. You MUST review this to check for errors and inconsistencies introduced during translation. Delete any duplicate or extraneous contacts or any errors. Then continue with edits to meet requirements, follow best practices, and add other contacts as desired.\n"},"contacts/summary-contact-requirements.html":{"url":"contacts/summary-contact-requirements.html","title":"Summary Contact Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Summary Contact Requirements\nThe following compiles all of the required and recommended contact information for project and product metadata.

If you prefer, you can use a generic data manager contact rather than an individual name.\nAt least one contact with the role of “author” is required.\n\nFunding / Allocation (for Projects only)\nSource (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For FWS projects, the default source is U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Regions or programs should be added as the funding \"administrator\" in the Other Contacts field.\nFunding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of \"administrator\").\n\nRecipient (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they should be added as separate allocations.\nThe Principal Investigator may be added n the Other Contacts field as \"principalInvestigator.\"\nFunding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator could include \"Ecological Services\" or a specific field office.\n\nDistribution (for Products only)\n\nAdd the relevant contact for “distributor” of the product.\n\n"},"publish/requirements-for-publishing.html":{"url":"publish/requirements-for-publishing.html","title":"Requirements for Publishing","keywords":"","body":"Requirements for Publishing\nPublishing requires the record to be a valid record, meaning that mdEditor checks that all required fields for a mdJSON file are present before allowing a record to be published.\nNote: mdEditor does not check for SA specific requirements as documented here.

Click on ScienceBase.\nA login window will appear on the right side of the screen - enter your ScienceBase ID and password, and click Login. When you are logged in, the login window will display who you are logged in as. The current user must have read/write permissions on ScienceBase for any items to be published (including parent items). You cannot publish until you are logged in.\n\nThe mdEditor Publishing Outline:\nYou will see a list of every valid record in mdEditor in the publishing outline with its ScienceBase Identifier (if the record already exists on ScienceBase) and its parent ScienceBase Identifier (if present in the metadata). This publishing outline shows records in a parent-child relationship and reflects what you would see when you publish to ScienceBase.\nRemember: Parent-Child relationships refer to how the records are organized and displayed on ScienceBase. This is different than the Project and Product associations identified within the metadata records.\n\n\nRecords without parent IDs already in their metadata will appear directly under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. These records will be published under the default parent identifier you established in the settings. The Default parent identifier is listed in the ScienceBase header, which is hyperlinked to the record on ScienceBase.\nRecords with parent IDs identified in their metadata will appear below a thick blue line and will be published under the parent ID listed in their metadata.\n\n\n\n\nItems directly below the ScienceBase header will be published under the ScienceBase item identified in your settings as “Default Parent Identifier.” Items below the blue line will be published under the parent ID specified in the metadata.\nFor example, if the Default Parent Identifier is your SA Community, then projects at the root level in the publishing outline will be added directly under your SA Community.  Products nested under a project in the outline will be added as a direct child item to the project item on ScienceBase. (Note: you may have other parent IDs identified in those records that are not loaded in mdEditor)\nNotes on Moving Records\nYou can drag and drop records to establish the parent-child relationship in the publish outline, eliminating the need to establish that relationship in ScienceBase. This will also allow you to move items around (e.g., move a product from one project to another) and see that change reflected on ScienceBase. Remember, this only affects parent-child relationships on ScienceBase (i.e. file structure in ScienceBase), not project-product associations.\nIf you do not want these parent IDs to change, do not drag and drop these records in the publishing outline.\n\nGeneral Notes on Parent IDs:\n\nIf you move a product under a different project, it will update that product’s parent ID.\nParent IDs established through the relationships in the publishing outline will overwrite existing parent IDs in the metadata.\nDragging and dropping a record onto the ScienceBase header at the top will set that record’s parent ID to the default parent ID you identified in Settings.\nIf you have existing parent IDs in your metadata (and want to keep them as is), do not drag and drop those records onto the ScienceBase header-- this will erase the existing parent ID and insert what you have set as the default parent identifier.\n\nStep 2: Move Records in the Publishing Outline\nBefore you move records in the publishing outline please select your scenario below and follow the corresponding guidance.\nScenario A\nYou do not have items on ScienceBase yet, and your desired parent-child relationship is to have each product as a direct child of a project item on ScienceBase:\n\nYour records will all display under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. \nThese items will be published as a direct child item under the SB item identified in your settings under “Default Parent Identifier.”\n\n\nYou can drag and drop records in the publishing outline to establish parent-child relationships for ScienceBase.\nYou can nest items in as many levels as you desire (the most common is a product nested under a project).\nTo move a record back to the root level, drag and drop it on the top line that says “ScienceBase Default”.\n\nScenario B\nYou have existing parent-child relationships on ScienceBase and/or you have intermediate folder(s) between project items and products (i.e., products are not direct child items of Project Items - this is not recommended).\n\nIf you have parent-child relationships already established on ScienceBase (and those IDs are reflected in the mdEditor records), you likely do not want to move the records around in the publishing outline.\nIf your products are housed in a “Products” folder on ScienceBase (or other intermediate folders between the project item and the products), then your products will not be nested under projects in the publishing outline. \nThe parent ID for those products is the “Products” folder (which would not have a record in mdEditor). If this is your situation, do not change the structure in the publishing outline and publish as is (i.e., with every item organized at the root level in the outline).\n\n\n\nStep 3: Submit for Publishing\n\nTo select a record to publish, click on it and it will turn green (click again to un-select it).\nYou cannot publish a record without a parent ID. Sending a non-existent parent ID to ScienceBase will return an error. If your records contain parent IDs in the metadata, you can choose to publish products without publishing their associated projects at the same time.\n\nmdEditor will publish your records sequentially, starting with the top record (it will publish the project first, then the products nested below it).\n\nIf you are publishing to your default parent identifier or if you have changed any project-product relationships in the publishing outline, you will see the updated parent IDs appear in the outline as publishing occurs. If you’re publishing to the existing locations on ScienceBase, the IDs will not change.\nThese new/updated IDs will be injected directly into the mdJSON file in mdEditor.

These files are essential for long-term access to metadata beyond a single work session.\nHow mdEditor Stores Information\nmdEditor stores information on your local computer in your browser's localStorage cache (not the normal file cache). This means that if you use a different browser to access mdEditor, it will not show the metadata records from your original browser. It also means that clearing your browser's cache generally will not delete your mdEditor records. However, depending on your browser's settings, clearing your browser cache may still delete your mdEditor data (e.g., in Chrome, checking the \"cookies and other site data\" option will clear your mdEditor data).\nWarning: In mdEditor settings, you can clear your storage cache. Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor. It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more.\n\nmdEditor File Format\nThe underlying format of the metadata from mdEditor is mdJSON, which was created specifically for mdEditor. There are two types of mdJSON files.\n\nmdJSON files are the format that is published from mdEditor and made available on ScienceBase and data.gov. Their default file name is md_metadata.json.\nmdEditor.json files are the files used by mdEditor. They contain extra information, such as settings, that tell mdEditor how to operate. Their default file name is mdeditor-timestamp.json.\n\nmdJSON files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built-in Export and Import functionality. The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load records into mdEditor, either from previously-saved mdEditor session, exported from another browser, or downloaded from ScienceBase.\nJSON = JavaScript Object Notation, an open source file format. mdEditor produces mdJSON. ScienceBase has their own specific format, called sbJSON.\n\nmdEditor File Management Strategies\n(1) Work on a project-by-project basis.\nTo keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your LCC uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.\"\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n(2) Leave information in mdEditor between work sessions.\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n(3) Export your contacts with your records.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\nIf contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.\n\n(4) Export frequently to backup your records.\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn more.\n"},"project-entry-guidance/associating-records.html":{"url":"project-entry-guidance/associating-records.html","title":"Associating Records: Project","keywords":"","body":"Associating Records: Project\nThe Associated section is used to connect metadata records with each other.

The target projects for the SA Science Catalog are science projects whose topics and resulting products have value to partners or the public being able to discover and access them. Many projects are the result of SA issued financial assistance agreements, contracts, or inter-agency agreements. However, not everything funded through one of these mechanisms needs to be in the Science Catalog. For example, a contract to maintain an individual website likely does not quality as a \"science project\" nor does it provide public-relevant information. A grant to develop an interactive landscape-conservation tool, however, would be a science project that results in public-relevant information.\nSA projects can also include other defined efforts that did not necessarily require the awarding of funds (i.e. internal efforts).\nIndividual data managers may want to track other projects using the same metadata format and store that information on ScienceBase, without publishing it to the SA Science Catalog.\n\nProducts\nA product is a resource, usually (but not necessarily) developed as an output from a project. Products can be tools, data, maps, reports, presentations, workshops, etc. These will usually be the direct result of a project though there may be some products without a parent project.\nNot every output of a project is necessarily a product, however. For example, meeting minutes do not have standalone value as a publicly-available resource.

If there are multiple recipients for a project, they need to be added as separate allocations.\nYou could add the Principal Investigator in the Other Contacts field as \"principalInvestigator.\"\nOther Contacts (Required)\nIn most cases, a program or region has allocated the funding for a project.  In order to track funds within regions and programs and provide proper credit, add the FWS region (yes, both the legacy region and the DOI unified region for now) as the funding \"administrator\" for all allocations. Recall that the funding source should identify the agency who supplied the funding (i.e. US Fish and Wildlife Service).  Also, add the program name, if applicable, as the funding \"administrator\".  \nFunding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator may also include \"Ecological Services\" or a specific field office.\n\nMarked Funding\nIn some cases, funds are marked for specific activities and include reporting requirements that accompany the funding allocations.  For example, EPA allocates Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funds on behalf of Congress to FWS, among others. FWS then distributes the funds across programs for use. The Gulf Coast Restore funds are a similar case. This funding flow can be tracked and aggregated with the Funding Other Contacts.  Add the Name of the funding source as an organization contact and add the funding source as the \"funder\" in Funding Other Contacts.\n\n\nFWS sub-activity, funding codes, agreement type (Best Practice)\nIn order to better integrate budgeting records and align with activity tracking priorities, add the FWS sub-activity code and funding code in the Allocation comments. Also add the funding For example, the text entry may look like this:  FWS sub-activity 1420, fundcode 190, contract.  If funds are provided from multiple sub-activities, please add this in the description (i.e. FWS sub-activity 1430, fundcode 170, $30,000: sub-activity 1420, fundcode 170, $10,000). At some point in the future, mdEditor may include additional fields for these values.\n\nMatching and In-kind Funds\nProject funds or in-kind support that were supplied by a partner (i.e., not specifically allocated to SA) should be included as an allocation as described above, but with the matching fund box checked. Each matching fund provider needs to be included as a separate allocation.\n\nTime Period\nDates (Required)\nFor each allocation, enter the fiscal year that funds were awarded (not the time span of the entire project). There should be a single fiscal year for each allocation. Adding a time period lets users know when your items were funded, and lets them find your item when searching for items funded in a similar time period.\nUse the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the date fields.\n\n\nExample of multiple allocations across several fiscal years for a single project record.\n\n"},"project-entry-guidance/keywords-tab.html":{"url":"project-entry-guidance/keywords-tab.html","title":"Keywords Tab: Project","keywords":"","body":"Keywords Tab: Project\nAdding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later through a search engine, keywords are the way to tag your projects or products. mdEditor is designed using existing thesauruses that contain pre-determined keywords. \n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project Keywords Tab\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nISO Topic Category\nRequired\n\n\nSA Priority Category\nRequired\n\n\nScience Topic Category\nRequired\n\n\nConservation Action Open Standard\nRequired, if applicable\n\n\nStrategic Habitat Conservation Component\nRequired, if applicable\n\n\nGCMD Keywords\nBest Practice\n\n\nShared Priority Keywords\nBest Practice\n\n\n\nAdd Keywords to your Project\n\nClick “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses.\nAdd keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses.\nIf none of the keywords in the following categories are sufficient for tagging your project, you can add other keywords with a custom thesaurus (see below for more information).\n\nSA Project Required Keywords\nISO Topic Category (Required)\nBecause mdJSON metadata is based on the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) metadata standard, all LCC projects must select at least one ISO Topic Category.

You can draw a polygon or a bounding box in the initial window.\nYou can export spatial extents and re-use for other records using the import feature button or by dragging and dropping onto the map.\nExtents are limited to 5000 vertices. Recommend you create only simple polygons or bounding boxes. If you want greater detail, attach high-definition shapefiles instead of trying to draw them.\nExtents should be accurate enough for searching purposes, but remember that they are metadata, not data.\nOption 1: Import Spatial Features\nSpatial features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However, file attributes (such as name and description), will not be imported and must be added manually.\nFor projects without a specific extent, you can use the FWS regional geography. Projects should have custom extents when it is relevant to the scope of the project. Remember, these extents will be used for search and discovery purposes. geoJSON files for all FWS regional and state geographies are available on ScienceBase (private DMWG folder that requires ScienceBase login).

It is a tool to add known taxonomic information to your metadata. If you want to explore ITIS, go to itis.gov to find information and then come back to mdEditor with the desired search values.\n\nThe minimum requirements for valid taxonomy are a Taxonomic System plus one or more taxonomic classifications.\nAdd Taxonomic System\n(1) Click \"Add Collection\"\n\n(2) From here, you can click \"Add Taxa from ITIS\" directly (on right side) without adding the taxonomic system. This will be filled in for you automatically once you have added items from ITIS.\n\n(3) Enter your search terms in the search box. You can type in a common name, scientific name, or TSN (Taxonomic Serial Number, assigned by ITIS). You can type in any level of taxonomy, not just species name (e.g., you can type in an order or class or genus). You can specify by Kingdom if you like.\nIf you haven’t used the search in a while (or ever) the ITIS service might be asleep so it will take a few more seconds to load but then will load quickly after that.\n\nThe status of the taxonomic classification is denoted in () after the TSN. ITIS may consider a classification \"invalid\" if the species was reclassified, for example. It is up to you whether you want to add invalid ITIS classifications to your metadata.\n\n\n(4) Click \"Add\" for the search results you want to add to your record and then click \"Import Taxa.\" You will get a message of successful import at the bottom of your screen.\nYou don't need to worry about clicking import multiple times for the same species. mdEditor is smart enough to know not to create duplicate entries of the same species.\n\n\n(5) Click \"Back to Collection.\" You will see that it has added a taxonomic hierarchy. It has also added a Title to Taxonomic System (if you hadn’t already added one by hand). This complete the the minimum information required for taxonomy.\nYou can click on any level of the taxonomic hierarchy to collapse the entries below that level.\n\nmdEditor only adds common names at the lowest taxonomic level you identified (e.g., species level).\n\n\n(6) You can add additional information regarding the taxonomic information if you desire.\nObservers would be filled out when there were people who actually went in the field/lab and identified species. Here you would lie the people who did that work.\n\nGeneral Scope: You can add a description of the range of taxa addressed in the dataset or collection.\nIdentification Procedure: You can describe the methods used for taxonomic identification.\nIdentification Completeness: You can add information regarding completeness and uncertainty in the identifications.\n\nVoucher is where you can add information about specimens you submitted to a museum or a storage facility where you are storing specimens, can document that here (select a Repository via a Contact entered in mdEditor).\n\nWhen Taxonomy is Needed\nTaxonomy is mostly used for search is discovery and functions similar to keywords.\nIf you have existing species names or other keywords, you do not need to delete those. Taxonomy is entered in a separate section in mdJSON so they are separate from Keywords.\n\nTo some extent, this is up to the judgement of the data manager. You will know best the connection of a resource to a specific species or other taxonomic group. For example, if a bear model was used to rank habitat for a prioritization product but the final output is not relevant to bears any longer, then you probably wouldn't want to add bear species in taxonomy.\nReporting Issues\nIf you encounter issues or bugs using the new Taxonomy feature, please report them in this github thread: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues/101 (requires github account to post).\n"},"product-entry-guidance/main-tab-product.html":{"url":"product-entry-guidance/main-tab-product.html","title":"Main Tab: Product","keywords":"","body":"Main Tab: Product\nThe Main tab allows for the creation and/or editing of primary metadata.\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Product Main Tab\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nResource Type\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contact\nRequired\n\n\nCitation: Title, Date, Responsible Parties, Online Resource\nRequired\n\n\nCitation: Identifier\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period: Start Date, End Date\nRequired\n\n\n\nBasic Information\nRecord ID\nWill be auto-generated but can be edited.\nTitle\nEnter as informative a title as possible.

Consult the Copy Records section of this manual to learn how to make a copy.\n\nDescription\nDescription allows for the addition of the Abstract as well as a Short Abstract, Purpose, Supplemental Information, and an Environment Description.\nAbstract\nEnter an Abstract\nTip: Write your abstracts for projects in the present tense if the project is underway and past tense if it has been completed.\n\nShort Abstract\nEnter a short description, limited to 300 characters, if desired.  The Best Practice here is to include a few sentences for media communications that Public Affairs may find helpful.\nSupplemental Information\nEnter comments, if desired.\nTime Period\nTime Period refers to project start and end date, or the date that the product was applicable.  For example, the time when a map is valid, date of publication, date of presentation, or dates when the data was collected.\n\nRequired: For each product, add a start date and end date.\n\n\n"},"documentation-guide.html":{"url":"documentation-guide.html","title":"Documentation Guide","keywords":"","body":"Documentation Guide\n\nAbout this guide\nWho is this guide for?\nWhat is it about?\n\n\nWorkflow\nSetup Environment\n\n\nStyle Guide\nHeadings\nLists\nOrdered lists\nList headings\n\n\nIcons\nButtons\nHints\nScreenshots\nTypes of screenshots\nRequirements for all screenshots\nRequirements for annotated screenshots\nScreenshot captions\nBookmarlet for Screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this guide\nWho is this guide for?\nThis guide is intended for parties interested in contributing to this documentation.\nWhat is it about?\nThis guide describes a recommended workflow and required conventions to be used when creating content.\nWorkflow\nSetup Environment\nWhile the online editor may be used, the most efficient way to create documentation is to install the GitBook Toolchain locally. See https://toolchain.gitbook.com/ for detailed instructions. The short version follows.\nThe following is required:\n\nNodeJS (v4.0.0 and above is recommended)\ngit\nA Markdown editor/IDE (ATOM is a good open source choice)\nWindows, Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X\n\n\n\nInstall gitbook-cli using npm:\n $ npm install gitbook-cli -g\n\n\nClone the mdEditor GitBook:\n $ git clone https://git.gitbook.com/cookmt/mdeditor-for-lccs.git\n\n\nSetup GitBook\n $ cd mdEditor-for-lccs\n $ gitbook install\n\n\nStart the local GitBook server\n $ gitbook serve\n\n\nOpen a browser to: http://localhost:4000\n\n\nStyle Guide\nThis section covers styling conventions required for this documentations. Some of the conventions rely on plug-ins that enhance the native GitBook Markdown functionality. In some instances, the effects of the plugins are not displayed until after the book has been generated.\nHeadings\nPlease use headings to define page sections. Heading levels should appear sequentially without gaps (don't skip heading levels). Headings should start at Level 1 for the page title. Headings should not be used purely to define font styles - if absolutely necessary, use CSS for that. Following this convention will make it possible to parse the markdown programmatically, e.g. to dynamically create a table of contents.\nLists\nOrdered lists\nOrdered lists are processed irrespective of the actual number assigned to each list item. For Example:\n1. first\n2. second\n3. third\n\n\nfirst\nsecond\nthird\n\n\nis rendered the same as:\n1. first\n12. twelfth\n30. thirtieth\n\n\nfirst\ntwelfth\nthirtieth\n\n\nTherefore, one recommended convention is to use 1. for every item in an ordered list. This makes it easier to insert or remove items from the list, at the expense of slightly less readable Markdown. If you choose to sequentially order the list items, you must make sure the numbers are sequential to avoid confusion.\nList headings\nHeadings may be use in lists. However, special handling is required to ensure bullets for ordered lists are styled appropriately.\nThe tasks tag is available for styling \"task lists\". For simplicity, all of the various heading levels are styled the same.\nExample without task tag\n\n1. ## Level 2\n1. ### Level 3\n1. ###### Level 6\n\nExample without task tag\n\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 6\n\n\nExample with task tag\n\n\n1. ## Level 2\n1. ### Level 3\n1. ###### Level 6\n\n\nExample with task tag\n\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 6\n\n\nIcons\nFontAwesome icons are available. Use an  tag to render the chosen icon.\n  Happy Birthday \n\n Happy Birthday \n\nButtons\nBootstrap 3 style buttons are supported. Use a  tag since these are for documentation only. Icons may be combined with buttons.\nDefault Primary  Success Info Extra - Small Warning - Small Danger - Large Link\n\nDefault\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\n Success\n\n\nInfo Extra - Small\n\n\nWarning - Small\n\n\nDanger - Large\n\n\nLink\n\nHints\nStyled hint blocks are supported.\n{% hint style='info' %}\nImportant info: this note needs to be highlighted\n{% endhint %}\n\nThere are five supported variations.\n\ninfo (default)\ntip\ndanger\nworking\nplain\n\nInfo: this note needs to be highlighted.\n\nTip: 20% is customary.\n\nDanger: this is going to blow up!\n\nWorking: for the man every night and day...\n\nPlain: booooooorrrrring.\n\nScreenshots\nThe following software is required:\n\nLibre Office Draw\nA tool to capture screenshots\nWindows, Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X\n\n\nTypes of screenshots\n\nbasic screenshots have no annotation or markup applied\nannotated screenshots have markup applied, e.g. callouts, highlights, etc.\n\nRequirements for all screenshots\n\nMinimum 1200px wide\nMust include a caption\nPNG format\nGenerally browser window captures should only contain minimum user interface controls, without navigation toolbar, tab bar, bookmarks toolbar, or status bar. See Bookmarlet for Screenshots.\n{caption class=border}\n\nImages should be stored in the assets directory corresponding to the section in which the image appears. Exceptions to this requirement are made for images used in multiple sections.\n\nImage sizes should be as small as possible without sacrificing quality.\nUsually significant size reduction can be achieved by color-type or bit-depth\nreduction. pngcrush is a good tool for this.\n\n\nRequirements for annotated screenshots\n\nUse LibreOffice Draw to create the annotations\n\nA template is available here /assets/documentation-guide/callouts-template.odg\nEach screenshot should be placed on a new page\nWhenever possible place annotations in callouts outside of the image or\nin a way that  does not cover user interface elements\n\nName the page using the name of the PNG file\n\nExport the screenshot to PNG\nonly export the\ncompression level 6\n1200 pixels wide\n\n\n\n\nAll annotated screenshots for a section should be stored in a single .odg file.\nSave the LibreOffice Draw file (.odg) in the directory with the screenshots\n{caption class=border}\n\n\nScreenshot captions\nTo apply a caption to a screenshot use this syntax in the Markdown.\n![caption goes here](/assets/path/to/image){caption}\n\n{caption}\nTo apply a border to a screenshot, add class=border.\n![caption goes here](/assets/path/to/image){caption class=border}\n\n{caption class=border}\nApplying the {caption} to a image will also indent the image from the surrounding text.\nBookmarlet for Screenshots\nUse this bookmarlet: Plain Window. Drag the link to your bookmarks bar or create a bookmark with the code below. Clicking the bookmark will open the current webpage in a plain window that is 1200px wide. Re-size to needed height and take a screenshot.
