<p>Guidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>On September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this <a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/READ%20ME%20FIRST.docx?d=wbbecf1f040af46c892c2246b50f327cb&amp;csf=1&amp;e=xoY6en" target="_blank">dashboard</a> for a list of resources.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-required-actions">Summary of Required Actions</h4>
<p>For all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):</p>
<ol>
<li>First determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>a.      If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using <a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&amp;file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">this template</a> and attach it to the official award file.</p>
