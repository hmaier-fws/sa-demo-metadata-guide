<ul>
<li>One or more Service regions or programs provides funding support for a project with one or more USGS Climate Adaptation Science Center (CASC) or other DOI agency where distinct sub-projects or products cannot be separately identified and attributed to either agency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metadata-responsibility">Metadata Responsibility</h2>
<p>This protocol was developed with the CASCc and therefore, focuses on their specific needs, but may be applied to other DOI agency collaborations. The Service data manager is responsible communications with the partner agency and for processing the project and product <a href="../../glossary.html#metadata" class="glossary-term" title="Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.">metadata</a> for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog. The CASC data manager will complete their <a href="../../glossary.html#metadata" class="glossary-term" title="Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.">metadata</a> responsibilities for the CASC records independently according to their requirements.</p>
<h2 id="co-funded-project-workflow">Co-funded Project Workflow</h2>
<p>For projects and products co-funded with the CASC, the CASCs will create their own <a href="../../glossary.html#sciencebase" class="glossary-term" title="A USGS collaborative scientific data and information management platform used directly by science teams. ScienceBase provides access to aggregated information derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from existing data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original content.

In order for those projects and products to be included in the SA Science Catalog, a duplicate <a href="../../glossary.html#metadata" class="glossary-term" title="Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.">metadata</a> records need to be created and linked to the CASC <a href="../../glossary.html#metadata" class="glossary-term" title="Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.">metadata</a> records.
