# Documents Tab: Product

The **Documents** tab is where you can add references to resources that _relate_ to your product but do not _define_ or _describe_ the project. These can include videos, webinars, books, posters, web pages, news releases, etc. This should not include links to LCC project or products. An example document could be a report for a workshop that inspired the product.

There are no LCC-specific requirements or best practices for documents.

{% hint style="info" %}
ScienceBase has a similar section called "weblinks." These will be populated in the Documents section if sbJSON is imported into mdEditor.
{% endhint %}

For more information, consult the Documents section of the mdEditor manual.
