# Documents Tab: Project

The **Documents** tab is where you can add references to resources that _relate_ to your project but do not _define_ or _describe_ the project. These can include videos, webinars, books, posters, web pages, news releases, etc. This should not include links to the project or its products. An example document could be a report for a workshop that inspired the project.

There are no specific requirements or best practices for documents.

{% hint style="info" %}
ScienceBase has a similar section called "weblinks." These will be populated in the Documents section if sbJSON is imported into mdEditor.
{% endhint %}

For more information, consult the Documents section of the mdEditor manual.
