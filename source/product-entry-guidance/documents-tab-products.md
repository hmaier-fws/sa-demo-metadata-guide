# Documents Tab: Product

The **Documents** tab is where additional references to resources that _relate_ to your product but do not _define_ or _describe_ the item are added. These can include videos, webinars, books, posters, web pages, news releases, etc. This should not include links to project or products. An example document could be a report for a workshop that inspired the product.

There are no SA specific requirements or best practices for documents.

ScienceBase has a similar section called "weblinks." These will be populated in the Documents section if sbJSON is imported into mdEditor.
