# Organization Contacts

## Create a New Contact

1. Click the plus \(![](../.gitbook/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)\) sign by **Contacts**.
2. Specify the contact is an **Organization.**
3. The **Contact ID** will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

_The following fields are available for **Organization Contacts:**_

* **Organization Name** \(Required\): The organization's full name; avoid acronyms \(however, abbreviating United States as U.S. is acceptable. Example: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\).
* **Contact Type** \(Required\): Enter the contact type from the picklist. Make sure every contact has Contact Type selected - this is essential for the Science Catalog funding summaries.
* **Email Address** \(Required\)**:** Add an email address of the primary contact in the organization.
* **Online Resource** \(Required\): Add a web URL where the organization resides. Online resource may also include social networks.
* **Physical Address** \(Best Practice\): Enter a physical address
* **Logo** \(Optional\):
  * You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image, mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into mdEditor.
  * If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will inherit the logos from the organization.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for the logo. Otherwise, an error will occur n the metadata records that include that contact.
{% endhint %}

_Commonly used organization contacts are populated_ _in the 'seed' contact list available on the_ [SA HQ ScienceBase community item](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5df8d2b7e4b0cdded73b4069) page.
