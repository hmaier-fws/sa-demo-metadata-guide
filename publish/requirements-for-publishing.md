# Requirements for Publishing

Publishing requires the record to be a **valid record**, meaning that mdEditor checks that all required fields for a mdJSON file are present before allowing a record to be published.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: mdEditor does not check for LCC requirements. It only looks for metadata that fills ISO requirements. Fulfilling LCC requirements falls on the creator of the records. Consult the [**Project Entry Guidance**](../project-entry-guidance/) and [**Product Entry Guidance**](../product-entry-guidance/) sections for LCC requirements.
{% endhint %}

Publishing requires every record to have a parent Identifier that identifies the ScienceBase folder where your record will be sent upon publishing. If you set up your Default Parent Identifier in [Settings](../settings.md), then you do not need to add a parent ID to your individual record. However, if you need to publish your record to a location different than your default folder, then you need to add a Parent ID to your metadata record \(see [Metadata/Parent Metadata](https://cookmt.gitbooks.io/mdeditor-for-lccs/content/record/main/metadata-tab.html#parent-metadata)\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Please use a testing folder before you update your real records. \(Consult the [**Instructions for Testing Publishing**](https://github.com/tpatterson1996/lcc-metadata-manual/tree/287090b07635d0e76a714278ce1f6c4aac3594cc/publish/instructions-for-testing-publishing.md) section of this manual for more information\).
